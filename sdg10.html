    <h3>Why SDG 10 Matters</h3>
    <p>
      SDG 10 focuses on reducing inequalities within and among societies — especially in access to education,
      opportunity, and resources. When inequality exists, talent is wasted, voices are silenced, and potential
      is lost. Education should never depend on privilege, location, or financial background.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fair world is one where everyone starts with access — not advantage. Reducing inequality strengthens
      communities, promotes social stability, and allows individuals to reach their full potential.
    </p>

    <h3>How SDG 10 Inspired Pathway</h3>
    <p>
      While studying, I noticed how fragmented and unequal access to learning resources can be. Some students
      have endless support and guidance, while others struggle to even find where to start.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pathway was created to address this gap — bringing structured, high-quality study materials into one
      accessible space. The goal is not to replace teachers, but to support students who need clarity,
      direction, and equal opportunity to learn.
    </p>

    <h3>How This App Can Help</h3>
    <p>
      Pathway provides curated subject resources, trusted educational videos, and guided study sections
      designed to reduce confusion and overwhelm. By centralizing learning materials, students can focus on
      understanding rather than searching.
    </p>
    <p>
      This platform supports SDG 10 by making education more inclusive, empowering students regardless of
      background, and helping bridge learning gaps through accessibility and structure.
