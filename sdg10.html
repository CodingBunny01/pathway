    <h3>Why it Matters</h3>
    <p>Inequalities limit opportunities for learning and growth. Many students do not have access to quality educational resources due to socio-economic factors, geographic location, or systemic barriers. Addressing these gaps is essential for fair development and empowerment of all students.</p>

    <h3>How SDG 10 Pushed Me</h3>
    <p>Learning about SDG 10 inspired me to create Pathway. I wanted to provide a platform where students, regardless of background, can access curated educational resources, videos, and study links. This aligns with the SDG’s mission of reducing disparities and promoting equal opportunity.</p>

    <h3>How Pathway Helps</h3>
    <p>Through curated subject sections, guided videos, study links, and interactive tools, Pathway provides students a way to access quality education at their fingertips. It’s designed to reduce the gap caused by unequal resources and empower students to achieve their learning goals.</p>
