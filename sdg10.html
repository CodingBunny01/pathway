  <h2>Why SDG 10 Matters</h2>
  <p>Reducing inequalities is essential for creating a fair world where every student, regardless of background, can access the education and tools they need to thrive. Inequality hinders potential, creates unnecessary barriers, and prevents communities from growing together.</p>
  <p>Education should be a bridge, not a privilege. By addressing gaps in access, students can unlock opportunities that were previously unreachable, fostering innovation, empathy, and social cohesion. Reducing disparities also empowers learners to pursue their dreams with confidence, knowing that resources and guidance are available.</p>

  <h2>How SDG 10 Inspired Pathway</h2>
  <p>Seeing the inequalities in access to quality study materials inspired the creation of Pathway. I wanted a platform that ensures students from different socio-economic backgrounds can find structured, high-quality learning resources all in one place. SDG 10 reminded me that even small steps toward equality can have a huge impact.</p>
  <p>By curating educational content and organizing it intuitively, Pathway helps level the playing field. Students can now explore subjects freely, discover valuable tutorials, and build a strong foundation for their academic journey.</p>

  <h2>How This App Can Help</h2>
  <p>Pathway provides structured resources, curated videos, and links for multiple subjects to help students bridge learning gaps. It encourages independent learning, promotes self-confidence, and equips students with the knowledge and tools to succeed academically.</p>
  <p>The platform also supports different learning styles, offering interactive content and clear navigation, making studying engaging, effective, and enjoyable for teenagers.</p>
