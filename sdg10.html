    <h3>Why SDG 10 Matters</h3>
    <p>
      SDG 10 focuses on reducing inequality within and between societies, especially in access to education, opportunity, and resources. 
      When inequality exists, talent is wasted and goes unnoticed. Potential is lost because voices are ignored, and people are never given 
      the chance to reach what they are capable of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Education should not depend on privilege, location, or financial background. Yet for many students, it does. 
      A fair world is one where everyone starts with access to the same resources. Reducing inequality strengthens communities
      and social stability, and allows individuals to grow without being limited by circumstances beyond their control.
    </p>

    <h3>How SDG 10 Inspired Pathway</h3>
    <p>
      While studying, I noticed how unequal access to learning resources can be. Some students have constant guidance,
      support, and clear structure, while others are left trying to figure everything out on their own. 
      This difference affects confidence, motivation, and academic progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pathway was created to address this gap. It brings structured and reliable study materials into one accessible space. 
      The goal is not to replace teachers, but to support students who lack direction and to raise awareness of the inequalities that exist within education.
    </p>

    <h3>How This App Can Help</h3>
    <p>
      Pathway provides curated subject resources and trusted educational videos to make studying clearer and more manageable. 
      By keeping learning materials in one place, students can spend less time searching and more time understanding. 
      It also brings attention to educational inequality and encourages reflection on how access shapes opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This platform supports SDG 10 by making educational resources more accessible and inclusive. It helps reduce learning gaps by 
      providing structure and guidance, allowing students from different backgrounds to engage with education on more equal terms.
