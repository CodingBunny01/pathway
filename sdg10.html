    <h3>Why SDG 10 Matters</h3>
    <p>Reducing inequalities is essential for creating a fair world where everyone has equal access to education, opportunities, and resources. Inequality not only limits potential, but also stifles innovation, hampers economic growth, and creates social tensions. Communities with high inequality often face challenges in health, education, and employment, which can perpetuate cycles of poverty for generations.</p>
    <p>Addressing these disparities ensures that every student, regardless of background, has the chance to learn, grow, and succeed. By focusing on fairness, society as a whole becomes stronger, more resilient, and more harmonious.</p>

    <h3>How SDG 10 Inspired Pathway</h3>
    <p>Seeing the gap in access to quality study resources motivated me to create Pathway. Many students struggle to find reliable, structured materials for their subjects, while others have abundant resources at their fingertips. This imbalance highlighted the urgent need for a platform that bridges this divide, making learning accessible and engaging for all.</p>
    <p>Pathway was born out of this vision: a space where students can explore curated videos, links, and interactive content, helping them maximize their potential and pursue their goals regardless of prior opportunities.</p>

    <h3>How This App Can Help</h3>
    <p>Pathway provides structured resources, including subject-specific videos, educational websites, and interactive tips, all in one place. By offering guided learning paths, students can focus on what matters most, develop confidence, and track their progress. This platform empowers learners to overcome barriers, discover new interests, and gain the knowledge needed to succeed academically and personally.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, Pathway fosters equal opportunities, encourages self-directed learning, and supports students in achieving their aspirations while promoting the ideals of SDG 10 in education.</p>
